          <h1>Meet My Crew!</h1>
            <p>My mommy and daddy love me very much! They also seem to love to take roadtrips everywhere because sometimes, when I get in the car, we end up driving for three or more hours! I usually just fall asleep in the back seat or chew on my rawhide bone. One time we even drove for like 13 hours! I was really tired after that one. </p>
            <p>Down below, you'll see the rest of my family. Copper is mommy's first puppy. He's five years old but he's gotten a little grumpy - especially when I run circles around him! Miller is daddy's puppy. We're the same age and we LOVE to wrestle all day, even if we're sleepy. Then there's Bailey. She's daddy's family's puppy. She's five years old like Copper. Mommy and daddy were a little worried that we wouldn't get along, but all I have to do is lay down and Bailey won't mind me. Sometimes she's even in the mood to play!</p>
