            <p>My name is River, but you can call me Mister Flister. It doesn't mean anything, but my parents thought it sounded cute and it just stuck. My favorite thing to do is explore outside and find new sticks to destroy. I also enjoy napping and practicing new tricks with my dad. I can't wait to tell you all about my adventures and let you in on all of mommy and daddy's secrets (but, shhh, don't tell them that).</p>
