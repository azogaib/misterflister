      <h1>All About Me, Mister Flister!</h1>
        <p>I'm  six months old! I was born June 10th in a small town named Rome, Georgia. My mommy and daddy visited me when I was only six weeks old and I just knew they were the ones. I even fell asleep in their arms! They had driven lots of hours from Orlando to come see me. Three weeks later, daddy came back and finally took me to my forever home. </p>

        <p>Now I live mostly in Auburn, Alabama - sometimes in Birmingham and even sometimes in Miami, Florida. My favorite thing to do is explore the great outdoors and find new sticks. The bigger the better! Daddy doesn't like it when I make a mess in the living room from chewing sticks. I love to cuddle but I get hot sometimes. I sometimes prefer to curl up near an air vent and cool off.</p>
